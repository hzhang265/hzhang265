Algorithm for Assignment 1 - first iteration - By Matthew Zhang

(1)Process raw user input and remove all formatting characters ('.','/','-') using .replace method. Then generate new digit-only string using a second argument as constraint. 

(2)Check the length of processed data, display error message when the data exceed the range entered.

(3)If the processed data passes length check, slice the string to get string data for year, month and day. Convert the data to integer type.

(4)Finally, check the range of year, month with 2 parameters for min and max value. Further check if the year is leap year by getting the remainder of the year by 2, 100, and 400. If the year is a leap year the dictionary value for Feburary is modified.

(5)Output the data if all above checks are passed.
